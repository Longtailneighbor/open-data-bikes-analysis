# Open Data Bikes Analysis

Analyze bikes sharing station data from Bordeaux and Lyon Open Data (French
cities).

Use the Python 3 programming language in Jupyter notebooks and the following
libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost.

## Clustering

Higly inspired by the
[Usage Patterns Of Dublin Bikes Stations](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/usage-patterns-of-dublin-bikes-stations-484bdd9c5b9e)
article and his great [notebook](https://github.com/jameslawlor/dublin-bikes-timeseries-analysis/blob/master/dublin-bikes-time-series-clustering-and-mapping.ipynb).

Analyze the hourly profile and plot a map with a color for each usage pattern.

## Predict (draft)

Play with some different models to predict the number of available bikes (or a
kind of availability).
